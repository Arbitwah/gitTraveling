        <h2>Mount Fuji</h2>
        <p>Wanting to Climb the famous Mount Fuji. Better plan ahead. You can only Climb Mount Fuji from July to Early September. Fuji is an active volcano. Just because Fuji is located in Tokyo don't expect it to be quick journey to get to the mountian.
          The Trip to just get to Fuji is around two hours depending on your mode of transportation. </p>

        <h2>Tokyo</h2>
        <p>Besides being Godzilla's favorite target city. Its also the Capital of Japan. Tokyo is a metropolitan prefecture. Tokyo has 23 special wards that are each governed as thier own individaul city. There is plenty to see and do given just how big
          Tokyo is.</p>

        <p>
          Tokyo is aslo the home of the Akihabara district. Known for its Electronics and Otaku Culture. Not a geek, but want to expereience japananese histroy and culture. There are plenty of Museums in East Tokyo. </p>

        <h2>Travelor's Reviews</h2>
        <p>
          "Toyko is by far the cleanest city to which I have ever travelled. It is aso the largest and busiest city to which I have ever travelled. The amount of effort the people of Tokyo go to in order to ensure both sanity and sanitation is simply astounding.
          Sights one must visit while in Tokyo include Harajuku (shopping/fashion), Ueno (Ameyoko for cheap shopping / Ueno Park/zoo), Shibuya (area for young adults), and Shinjuku (nightlife / red light district)." &mdash; GyozaFace, Tripadvisor</p>
        <p>"We just got back from spending 9 amazing days in Tokyo, and already want to go back. There is so much to see and do there. For those who have never been to a foreign country, don't let that stop you. Tokyo is very safe. And the language barrier
          is difficult at times, but there are enough Japanese that speak at least some English that this is not a problem. I traveled with my sister plus my older teenage daughter and son. We felt perfectly safe everywhere we went, day or night. You
          travel everywhere on trains which are fast and efficient. My best recommendation is to buy a Suica card that you can easily add money to in any subway station. Then just flash your card when going through the turnstiles. It automatically subtracts
          the correct subway fare. You can even use the Suica card to buy merchandise at some stores. Tokyo is an amazing city of both old and new...It is a wonderful destination - you won't regret it. I cant' wait to go back." &mdash; mom_on_a_budget
